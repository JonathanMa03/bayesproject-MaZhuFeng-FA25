```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
breast <- readRDS("../R/breast_model.rds")
```

Model is loaded from an RDS object.

# Rhat and ESS

```{r Summary}
summary(breast)
```

All Rhat and ESS Values look valid, and 1 divergent transition, but its small enough to be due to chance.

# VIF

We check VIF, and confirm all values are reasonable.

```{r VIF}
car::vif(lm(latestage ~ age + sex + raceth + grade + size_z + year_z + marry, data = seer_df2))
```

# Posterior Draws

Checking Posterior Draws

```{r PP Draws, echo=TRUE}
pp_check(brm_model2, ndraws = 100)
```

Posterior draws look Ok as well.
